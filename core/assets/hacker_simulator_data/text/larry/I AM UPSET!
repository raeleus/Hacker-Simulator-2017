I heard about what you're about to do. I REALLY DON'T APPRECIATE YOU GIVING MY PROMOTION TO THE INTERN. I've been working day and night on your project and I'm SICK AND TIRED of being ignored. CONSIDER THIS MY RESIGNATION!!! PS - Your star employee uses your account to print cat memes. HAH HAH HAH!
